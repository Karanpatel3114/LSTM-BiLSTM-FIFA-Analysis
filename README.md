# ⚽ LSTM vs BiLSTM on FIFA Player Dataset

This project compares two deep learning models — **LSTM** and **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** — using FIFA player datasets from 2015 to 2021.

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- ✅ **LSTM** — Long Short-Term Memory
- ✅ **BiLSTM** — Bidirectional LSTM

📍 Implemented using Python & TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebooks.
